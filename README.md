# AF Hello Gatsby

Basic Hello World in Gatsby.

Should be live -- hosted at Github Pages -- here:
https://adamfinkelstein.github.io/hello-gatsby/

* Jun 2024: removed gh-pages branch because I was getting warnings from GH about security vulnerabilities.

Continuous deployment workflow described in
[this Medium post](https://medium.com/@sam-king/deploying-a-gatsby-site-to-github-pages-using-github-actions-ci-cd-be0465a8cdb8). 
It relies on the [Gatsby Publish](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gatsby-publish) Github Marketplace action.
